# Programming Languages Part A

Pretty fascinating stuff. I haven't had any experience with functional programming languages--I dabbled a little with Lisp but never actually built anything, only did the quizzes off of the German (?) university site that had that spaced repetition style learning quiz tutorial. 

HW 1 was enjoyable and still took some effort. HW 2 is a jump in difficulty for me. The cool thing is that I don't think I ever had a good working grasp of how and why to use tail recursion and week 3 is making me confront that. 

## What I wrote prior to the course starting
University of Washington course, Programming Languages Part A. Starts April 2019.

Apparently will touch on ML, Racket, and Ruby. I think it's a course somewhat similar to the EdX courses that were based on How To Design Programs, 2nd Edition. Alas, those courses on EdX no longer show the majority of the assignments--questions and the grader have been locked behind a paywall. I'm thankful that Coursera still seems to have this one open...
