## Tidbits

SML's if then else statement needs the else! Can't get away with if then. 

fun is a keyword for declaring functions, so you can't use it for a variable. 

Semicolons are optional in the code of the file--they're required in the REPL. 

Gotta type val before a new expression! 

In the if expression, the then and else have to have matching expressions. 

Minus is a binary operation in SML. Can't write val a = - 5...

Negation/negative is the TILDE character! 

So you'd write val a = ~5 or val a = 0 - 5

Cannot use / division on integers. That's for floats. 
Gotta use div! 5 div 4 = 1. 
div is integer division.
